YATZEE - THE FUN DICE GAME

Object: To roll the highes score	Tools: Five dice, flat smooth surface
Start: Everyone rolls a die, high roll to start. Each turn gets THREE ROLLS. 

Scoring: Upper and Lower: 
	The Upper tricks are multiples of rolls of 1 - 6, with a possible bonus. For example, a roll of four 4s gives 	 a score of 16, not the 16 plus the last die. The Upper has a 63 pt. threshhold. Hit and get 35 pt. bonus. 
	The Lower tricks:  FH (Full House) - 3x/2x- kind split, a SS (Short Straight) of 4 dice, and a LS (Long Straight) 	of 5 dice. Yatzee is 50 pts., then 100 pts. per hit. An extra yatzee requires a regular slot be filled, too, i.e. 	4s or a 3x.  Use 'Chance' whenever. Place zero "0" scores in red ink. Clear boxes before replay.
OPTIONAL :  Players must complete the Upper before the Lower tricks.
